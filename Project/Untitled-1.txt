good morning chairman.

ladies and gentlemen,dear debates.the relation between human and nature
is always a hot topic after the industrial revolution.our sides firmly
believe that human can conquer nature.

first of all,before we start the debate.we must acknowledge the meaning 
of our key word--conquer.what does conquer mean?with oxford english
dictionary,we can know that "conquer" means "to succeed in dealing with
or controlling sth."this will be a key point in the following debates
so,i want you all to remember this meaning in case of unnessesary quarrel.

based on the meaning of the word "conquer",wo can draw this conclusion that
human can conquer nature means human have or will have the ablitiy to deal
with or control nature.

but at this moment,someone may ask why we are still afraid of the nature 
power.this is a good question.first,to be honest,we still have a long way
to go to conquer nature.but it only means nowadays, we can not conquer 
nature yet,which does not mean we can not hava the ability in the future.
human's technology development is exponential.we have just have a look at
the first picture of blackhole last night.to say the least,even if we could
conquer nature now.we will still choose not to do that,because we know that
conquering nature may bring benefit to us.but the benefit is based on broking
the balance of nature.it will do harm to the other partners of ecosphere.
the harm is much more than benefit.

that's all. thank you.
